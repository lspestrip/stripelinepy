'''The functions and classes provided in this submodule allow to compute
maximum-likelihood maps and perform analysis on condition numbers.

Here is an overview of the tools provided by this submodule:

- :class:`ConditionMatrix` allows to compute the inverse condition numbers from
  a timeline. It is mildly useful in the context of STRIP data analysis, because

- :func:`binned_map` bins a map, assuming only uncorrelated noise.

The functions implemented in this code are still not able to take advantage of
MPI.

class ConditionMatrix:
    '''Compute the inverse condition number for pixels in a map

    This class computes the inverse condition number of the pixels in a map,
    given one or more streams of samples taken from TODs. Condition numbers
    are useful to quantify how well map-makers are able to derive the I/Q/U
    components of the sky signal. This class computes the *inverse* condition
    numbers, which is the most widely used approach: condition numbers range
    from 1 (best case, perfect I/Q/U reconstruction) to infinity (worst case),
    while inverse condition numbers range from 0 (no possibility to disentangle
    I/Q/U) to 1 (best case).

    A typical usage of this class is to create an object and repeatedly call
    the :func:`ConditionMatrix.update` method with part of all the samples
    in the TOD. When all the TODs have been processed, the function
    :func:`ConditionMatrix.to_map` can be used to trigger the computation
    of the condition numbers and produce a map.
